# F1 2025 Season Champion Predictor

## Description

I made a PyTorch model that predicts the champion of the 2025 season in F1.
I trained it with the data set that I created from the seasons 2022-2024.
I wrote the code in a JupyterNotebook because when creating models like this, it makes it easier for me readability wise.

## Why? Why not?

You might be wondering why I created such model when it is obvious who will win, well I just wanted to test myself.
A little spoiler: It's Norris.

### Important Note

Note that every time you train the model the results might vary, it will still show it as the Norris with the highest probability however the percentages will change because of how small the dataset is.
It is small because I had to create it myself since there was not a dataset like this on the internet.
