# F1 2025 Season Champion Predictor

## Description

I made a PyTorch model that predicts the champion of the 2025 season in F1.
I trained it with the data set that I created from the seasons 2022-2024.
I wrote the code in a JupyterNotebook because when creating models like this, it makes it easier for me readability wise.

## Why? Why not?

You might be wondering why I created such model when it is obvious who will win, well I just wanted to test myself.
